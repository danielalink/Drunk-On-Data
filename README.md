# Sentiment Analysis_2018 World Cup_Twitter
World Cup is one of the biggest sport events worldwide. 
Everyone shares their thoughts and emotions to each other especially when their own team is having a game.
We wanted to visualize the change of people's emotions from their team's performance.

We have used **pandas**, **tweepy**, **vaderSentiment**, and **gmap** for our tools for this project.

## Limitations
Before we move on, below are the limitations we set up:

1. The tweets we collected are only those written in English. This was because we wanted to equalize the language of our analysis. This might not represent the exact sentiments for countries whose most used language isn't English.

2. 
A python script Vader analysis of tweets based on the key word " World Cup 2018" to see how people feel about a certain match happening during the selected WEEK.
Heat map shows green if tweets from the area are postive and red if they are negative.
